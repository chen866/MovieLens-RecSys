# MovieLens-RecSys
UserBasedCF and ItemBasedCF tested on MovieLens 1M dataset.<br>
基于Movielens-1M数据集实现的UserBasedCF和ItemBasedCF推荐算法

## Introduction
Implementation of UserCF and ItemCF algorithm.<br>
The programs are tested on Movielens 1M dataset. You can download this dataset by this link [ml-1m.zip](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-1m.zip).<br>
The recommendation result is evaluated by Precision, Recall, Coverage and Popularity.

## How to run
1. Put the "ml-1m" folder in the directory MovieLens-RecSys.
2. Simply run command:
```shell
python usercf.py
```

This command will let the program run in back stage and run.log will record all outputs of the program.

## Attention
In UserBasedCF,the program will generate a big matrix which comsumes a lot of memories (about 2.2GB in my computer). So make sure that your computer have enough memories to run the program.
ItemBasedCF doesn't have the problem of memories.
